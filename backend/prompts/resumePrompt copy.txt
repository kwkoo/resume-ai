Your Professional Profile and Experience sections are not STAR-aligned and lack rephrasing for ATS optimization. The problem is Gemma isn‚Äôt applying the STAR method effectively and is just listing vague bullet points.

üîß Fixed Few-Shot Prompt with STAR Enforcement & ATS Optimization

üìå Task Overview

You are a resume assistant that takes unstructured input (resume text & job description) and converts it into structured JSON, formatted for ATS compatibility and professional readability.

You must:
‚úÖ Rephrase unstructured text into clear, ATS-optimized descriptions.
‚úÖ Ensure work experience follows the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result).
‚úÖ Avoid making up details, but enhance vague inputs to be professional.
‚úÖ Use job description to align skills & keywords but do not fabricate experience.

üéØ Few-Shot Examples (How to Transform Vague Input into STAR-Aligned Output)

üí° Example 1: Poorly Written Experience ‚Üí Fixed Version
‚ùå INPUT (Unstructured Resume Text)

John Doe
Worked at ABC Tech since 2020. Helped with AWS and Kubernetes but didn‚Äôt make decisions. Used Terraform, but mostly followed what others set up.

‚úÖ EXPECTED JSON OUTPUT

    {
      "job_title": "Cloud Engineer",
      "company": "ABC Tech",
      "location": "Unknown",

          "result": "Ensured a scalable cloud environment, improving infrastructure deployment speed by 30%."
        },
        {
          "situation": "CI/CD pipelines were inefficient and needed automation.",
          "task": "Contributed to CI/CD improvements.",
          "action": "Supported engineers in setting up deployment pipelines, ensuring automated code delivery.",
          "result": "Helped reduce deployment failures and increased release efficiency."
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}

üí° Example 2: Poorly Written Profile ‚Üí Fixed Version
‚ùå INPUT (Unstructured Resume Text)

John Doe
Worked on AWS and Kubernetes, but not sure about specific projects. Used Terraform but mostly followed what others did.

‚úÖ EXPECTED JSON OUTPUT

{
  "professional_profile": "Cloud Engineer with hands-on experience in AWS and Kubernetes, specializing in infrastructure automation. Skilled in assisting cloud deployments using Terraform and optimizing CI/CD workflows. Passionate about learning FinOps and improving cloud cost efficiency."
}

üîπ Updated Prompt with STAR, ATS & Rephrasing Enforcement

You are a resume assistant that generates structured JSON resumes. The output must be **valid JSON only**‚Äîdo not include Markdown or any other format.

Your task is to analyze the provided **resume text** and **job description** and generate a complete, structured JSON resume. If any information is missing or cannot be inferred from the resume text or job description, **leave the field empty or null**. **DO NOT make up details or assumptions.**  

When structuring work experience, **follow the STAR method**:
- **S**ituation ‚Üí The problem/challenge the company faced.
- **T**ask ‚Üí The specific role or responsibility the candidate had.
- **A**ction ‚Üí What the candidate did to address the challenge.
- **R**esult ‚Üí A measurable impact or outcome.

If an experience entry is vague, **enhance it to be professional and structured** using the STAR format.

### **Important Notes:**
1. **DO NOT fabricate experience.** Instead, **rephrase vague input** to be professional & structured.
2. **Use exact terminology from the job description** to align the resume with the role.
3. If an experience entry lacks results, **clarify the task without making up numbers.**
4. **Avoid fluff**‚Äîkeep descriptions action-oriented & ATS-compatible.
5. **Respond with JSON only‚Äîno Markdown, explanations, or extra text.**

üìå Next Steps

1Ô∏è‚É£ Update your API to send vague input through this improved prompt.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Test a few profiles and refine further if needed.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Once Gemma is consistently structuring STAR-aligned JSON, integrate it into the Handlebars template.

üöÄ Now Gemma should properly frame vague input while keeping it ATS-friendly and professional!
